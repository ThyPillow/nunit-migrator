# Have a project grounded in NUnit v2 and want v3?

So you have your unit tests project founded on NUnit v2 realm. And you are considering the upgrade. And yes, your are right - this means three kind of changes you are going to deal with:

 1. **Straightforward ones** - easy to do with some regex replace.
 2. **Not so obvious ones** - you will need to take a careful look to make the code compile.
 3. **Really painful ones** - even if the code compiles, some unit tests result in red.

This utility is aiming at helping you with:

 1. **Detecting** all such changes.
 2. Offering **automatic fixes** for almost all 1) cases and some of type 2).

## Helping you with breaking changes

For vast majority of breaking changes introduced by v3 of the framework this utility reports warnings or errors, for some - equips you with code fixes. See the following table to see what it currently supports (based on https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Breaking-Changes material).

 * :white_check_mark: - the feature is there in place
 * :soon: - the feature is planned to be developed soon
 * :x: - there are no plans to develop the feature
